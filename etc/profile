# lots of bashisms
#   can likely work with ash/dash with...
#     - BASH_SOURCE[0] replaced with $(realpath $_) - must be first command
#       - or not, $0/$_ isn't consistent across shells, $_ is funky in posix
#     - ${...//::/:} doesn't seem to work in dash
#     - this all sucks
#
# XXX - need a short-circuit env var to bail out before profile.d/local.d sourcing
# XXX - speed up/eliminate tons of subshells on append_ funcs using awk...
# XXX - eg, for PATH:
#         export PATH="$(echo "${PATH}" | tr ':' '\n' | awk '!seen[$0]++' | paste -s -d: -)"
# XXX - seems supported by:
#       - mawk (including chromeos)
#       - gawk
#       - busybox awk
#       - onetrueawak
#       - 9base/plan9port awk
#       - baseutils awk
#       - heirloom awk/nawk (not oawk)
# XXX - save OLDVAR="${VAR}" then `|| export VAR="${OLDVAR}"` to catch awk failure?
#

# XXX - probably need realpath in the chain here somewhere
# get our etc and bin dir
